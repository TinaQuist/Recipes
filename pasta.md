Creamy Garlic Parmesan Pasta
Ingredients (serves 2–3):

200g (7 oz) pasta (fettuccine, spaghetti, or your favorite)

2 tbsp olive oil

3 cloves garlic, minced

1 cup heavy cream

½ cup grated Parmesan cheese

1 tbsp butter

Salt and black pepper to taste

Optional: Fresh parsley, chili flakes, lemon zest, grilled chicken or shrimp

Instructions:

Cook the Pasta
Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta according to the package instructions until al dente. Reserve ½ cup of pasta water, then drain the pasta.

Make the Sauce
In a large pan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add minced garlic and sauté for about 1 minute until fragrant (don’t burn it).

Add Cream & Cheese
Pour in the heavy cream and bring to a simmer. Stir in butter and grated Parmesan cheese. Keep stirring until the sauce thickens slightly. Season with salt and pepper.

Combine with Pasta
Add the cooked pasta to the sauce. Toss everything together, adding a bit of the reserved pasta water if the sauce needs thinning.

Garnish & Serve
Serve hot, topped with extra Parmesan, chopped parsley, or chili flakes. Optional: Add grilled chicken or shrimp for a protein boost.
